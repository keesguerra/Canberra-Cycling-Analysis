## Key Findings & Visualizations

My analysis of Canberra's cordon count data revealed a cycling network characterized by a dominant central hub and a high degree of stability in its usage patterns.

### 1. Finding: Civic is the Undisputed Hub

The data makes it clear that Civic is the primary hub for cycling traffic in Canberra. The total cyclist count in the Civic town centre is overwhelmingly higher than all other town centres combined, establishing it as the core of the network.

### 2. Finding: Yearly Traffic is Stable and Predictable

Across the four years of available data (2015-2018), the total number of cyclist trips recorded remained remarkably consistent. This lack of major fluctuation suggests that cycling is a mature and stable component of Canberra's transport system, not a volatile trend.

### 3. Finding: The Daily Commute is Balanced and Consistent

When looking at the time of day, cyclist traffic is very balanced between morning (AM) and afternoon (PM) periods. While there is a slight preference for morning travel, the overall pattern points to a consistent, two-way commute.

This balance between AM and PM travel was not a one-off occurrence; the pattern remained stable across all four years of the study, further reinforcing the predictability of the network.
